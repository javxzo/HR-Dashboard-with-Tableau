# Human Resources Dashboard - Tableau Project ðŸ“Š

This project was to practice Tableau. It's probably one of my bigger and longer projects but it was very worth it as I now can see the Tableau UI in my dreams. The dataset was generated using ChatGPT and the Faker library to simulate real HR data. The dashboard has two interactive pages that provide insights into key employee metrics! 

Side note: I hate tooltips! (but they're very nice to add)
